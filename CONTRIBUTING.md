## ⚙️ How to Contribute

### 🐞 Reporting Bugs
If you find a bug, please:
1. Search existing issues to avoid duplicates.

### 💡 Suggesting Features
To request a feature:
1. Check if a similar idea exists in Issues.  
2. Open a **Feature Request** with the corresponding template.  
3. Clearly describe *why* it's needed and *how* it could help users.

### 🧪 Improving Tests
Found missing or failing tests?  
Use the **Test Case** issue template to report or suggest improvements.

### 📖 Documentation
Contributions to documentation (readmes, tutorials, examples) are highly appreciated!  
- Keep writing clear, concise, and beginner-friendly.
